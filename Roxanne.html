								<p>Roxanne, the robot, was part of OSU robot competition consisting of 4 people. Our team had to design, build, and code the robot and I was the main programmer of the group. The robot was controlled using a Proteus, which has a Freescale ARM Cortex M-4 processor, allowing contestants to code in C++. The goal was to produce a robot with a low budget and for the robot to complete a custom designed obstacle course. The obstacle course consists of pressing a button, moving a slider, dropping a coin, and moving a lever. </p>
